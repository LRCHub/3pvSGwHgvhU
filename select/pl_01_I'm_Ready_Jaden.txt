(Woo)
Swingin' through the kingdom
in the night
(Woo)
I only see you in the city light
I'm fresher than fresh (Woo)
I step out the steps
We're all runnin' for the flex
Pete told me I was next (Woo)
I'm comin' for next
There really isn't no question
(Woo)
Only superheroes in this section
Only big bang is on the setlist
On top of buildings
where I eat breakfast
Then I shine like a new necklace
I'm ready to go,
she callin' my phone
Girl I'm comin' over
I got somethin' to prove to show
to the world
Can't hold it no longer
They think I'm way too young
To stand up for the ones I love
But let me tell you somethin'
(Ooh)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready (Ready)
To take on the world, I'm ready
(Ready)
You can't stop me now
Ah-ah-ah-ah
(Ooh)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready (Ready)
To take on the world, I'm ready
(Ready)
You can't stop me now
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Yeah (Yeah)
Callin' no one, gotta tell 'em
(What?)
Young with the vision
and they couldn't see it
Man,
just had the picture developed
I got it, yeah (Yeah)
Fly, whip up the propellers
(Why)
All of these fellas are jealous
(Jealous)
Just 'cause I'm young
and I'm calloused
Swing through the window
while I'm anxious
I'm ready to go,
she callin' my phone
Girl I'm comin' over
(I wonder why)
I got somethin' to prove to show
to the world
Can't hold it no longer
(Let's go)
They think I'm way too young
To stand up for the ones I love
But let me tell you somethin'
(Ooh)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready (Ready) (Let's go)
To take on the world, all ready
(Ready) (Let's go)
You can't stop me now
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Hey, hey, let's go)
(Ooh)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready (Ready) (Hey)
To take on the world, all ready
(Ready) (I'm ready)
You can't stop me now (Why?)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
You know who you are
They trip on the rooftops
Gotta fight for the truth
and it's war (War)
Don't let this city go dark
You know who you are
This is why
they fill out the shoes
They kill on me while I fightin'
on the villain (Woo)
She know what the deal is
They come for the heroes
She made me walk on the ceilin'
(Woo)
Just ask, they know
where the ill is
Spidey-sense,
I feel the pressure
They really think
they can get us?
They checkin' the drip
when I flip off the buildin'
I'm ready!
(Ooh)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready (Ready) (Let's go)
To take on the world, all ready
(Ready) (Let's go)
You can't stop me now
Ah-ah-ah-ah
(Yeah, yeah, let's go)
(Ooh)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,
I'm ready (Ready) (Hey)
To take on the world, all ready
(Ready) (I'm ready)
You can't stop me now (Why?)
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Let's go)
