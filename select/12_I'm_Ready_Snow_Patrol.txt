This island calls my name, and I
Broke out in two
The gods find you, and your calm and they
Rip down the sky
The path clears for long enough to glimpse
Where you should be
Are you wolf, or are you lamb are you
Too scared to choose?
I'm ready for the answers
I'm ready for the trap
I'm ready to be shocking
I'm ready to be shocked
Your cold hands feel good on me and my
Scorched heart cools fast
A stranger taught me all I know of
The world and not the thirst
The alleyways and darkest lanes in my
Tired mind form a star
A frightening star of dark red heat that burns
Through my whole body
I'm ready for the answers
I'm ready for the trap
I'm ready to be shocking
I'm ready to be shocked
