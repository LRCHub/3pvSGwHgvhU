We came into your world,
Not knowing what to do
You woke us up at dawn
As to dance in outerspace
Coming, coming, I'm coming down to you
Coming, coming, and are you ready?
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Yes I am
I'm Ready, I'm Ready,
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Yes I am
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Move Me Disco
You told us to move up
And computers here to stay
No workers at the beat
Just a dancer on the stage
Coming, coming, I'm coming down to you
Coming, coming, and are you ready?
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Yes I am
I'm Ready, I'm Ready,
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Yes I am
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Move Me Disco
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Yes I am
I'm Ready, I'm Ready,
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Yes I am
I'm Ready, I'm Ready, Move Me Disco
